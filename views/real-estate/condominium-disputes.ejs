    <h2>Protect Your Interests During Condo Disputes</h2>
    <p>Condominium disputes can quickly become complex. Depending on the nature of the dispute, numerous parties may be involved, including:</p>
    <ul class="medicalList"><li>
            <strong>Homeowners associations (HOAs) disputes —</strong> HOAs regulate how condominium properties are used. While regulations can provide stability for residents, they can also be too strict resulting in disputes between HOAs and residents. Disputes often involve disagreements over the use of shared space, alleged violations of HOA rules and dues collection.
        </li><li>
            <strong>Disputes with developers and contractors —</strong> Shoddy workmanship, failure to disclose defects and other issues during the construction, purchase or sale of condo units can arise.
        </li><li>
            <strong>
                <a href="./Landlord-tenant-issues">Disputes with tenants</a> —
            </strong> If you rent your condo to a tenant, disputes involving property damage, unpaid rent and other issues may arise.
        </li><li>
            <strong>Disputes with other condo owners —</strong> When living in close proximity, disputes between neighbors often arise. Disputes range from nuisance claims to shared cost disagreements and property damage claims.
