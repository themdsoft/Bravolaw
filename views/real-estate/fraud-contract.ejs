    <h2>Failure To Disclose Property Defects And Breaches Of Contract</h2>
    <p>Real estate transactions are large financial undertakings. Both parties have a duty to deal openly and honestly. When known defects are intentionally concealed or undisclosed, purchasers may be left with expensive repairs they didn't bargain for. </p>
    <p>Information sellers are typically required to disclose include:</p>
    <ul><li>Issues surrounding the physical condition of the property</li><li>Any dangerous conditions or materials</li><li>Liens against the property</li></ul>
    <p>Contract disputes can also arise during property transactions. Purchase and sale agreements contain many provisions, including:</p>
    <ul class="medicalList">
        <li>Purchase price</li>
        <li>Closing date</li>
        <li>Legal description of the property</li>
        <li>Title guarantees</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If either party fails to perform its duties, a breach may occur and legal action can ensue. </p>
