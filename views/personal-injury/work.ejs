    <p>After being injured on the job many workers believe their only form of compensation is through California's workers' compensation system. This is not necessarily true. In some cases you may have a personal injury claim against a third party that you may pursue as well as a workers' compensation claim.</p>
    <p class="callOut">If you were injured at work by a third party, such as an independent contractor, or the driver of another vehicle while performing job duties â€” you may be entitled to additional compensation.</p>
    <p>Located in San Francisco, Bravo Law Offices has more than three decades of experience helping injured workers throughout the Bay Area maximize their compensation. We are not afraid to fight. Our lawyers will get you the money you deserve.</p>
